# Student Paginated List
## This page displays students and their respective info

### Features I added:
* The showPage function displays a page of nine students
* The addPagination function adds pagination buttons to the page that allows you to view all the student info
* The showSearchBar function displays a search bar to the page
* The addSearchFunctionality function adds functionality to the search bar by returning students that match the input in the search bar


### Instructions:
* Open the index.html file in Google Chrome
* Click the numbered buttons at the end of the page to view other student info
* To search for a student by name, enter the name in the search bar at the top right of the page
* The search bar will filter and display students if their first or last name contains any of the characters entered into the seach bar
* If the characters entered into the search bar are not in the first or last name of a student, the page will return "No Results Found"
